# Healthcare_Analysis_internship_work

During my internship as a Data Science Project Intern at Ineuron Pvt Ltd, I had the opportunity to work on a healthcare analysis project. Using Python programming language, I utilized data analytics techniques to extract insights from large healthcare datasets.

I utilized libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn to clean, preprocess, and visualize the data. I also utilized machine learning algorithms like linear regression and decision trees to build predictive models that could aid in decision-making.

Overall, this internship gave me the chance to gain hands-on experience in data science and apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems. I am grateful for the opportunity and excited to continue my journey in the field of data science.
